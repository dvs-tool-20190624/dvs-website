Pitch: Financial insecurity is the No. 1 reason survivors of domestic violence remain in or return to abuse. In order to break the cycle of violence, we must remove obstacles to financial security for survivors. To that end, FreeFrom (https://www.freefrom.org/) is developing an interactive calculator for their website. It will serve survivors to enable them to better understand the costs of leaving and staying safe. The calculator will include prompts to help users understand and identify the relevant costs. This project will not only help survivors and raise awareness of the costs of domestic violence, but will also capture valuable data that will help FreeForm drive positive policy change!
MVP:
*A domestic violence survivor can come to the page and insert their data into the online calculator.
*There will be two steps to the calculator, a personal monthly budget to determine what costs they need to cover, and a way to calculate the costs of relocating
*the monthly personal budget will allow them to enter their ongoing unavoidable costs they might have while trying to relocate. The fields include Transportation, Food, Health Insurance, car insurance, health car, car loans, personal loans, and other expenses
*The relocation costs include: Daily hotel costs while in transit (if applicable, nightly rate * 30), new rental deposit, utility connection fees, storage unit, new monthly rent (if they already know this number), car rental and gas (if don't own a car), cell phone disconnection/connect fee (if they have to get a new number), moving truck rental, gas for moving truck, storage unit if unable to take their things with them, mental health treatment, income loss (what they are loosing by leaving their current job), cost of any additional security measures they must take
*After they have entered these fields, a page will show up combining their total monthly expenses plus the monthly cost of relocation.

Rubric:
MVP work - Project should incorporate all of the listed MVP features:
1.Student did not achieve all of the MVP features of the project.
2. Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built.
3.Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built and the student went above and beyond the project.
Team contribution:
1. Participated by contributing but didn't communicate changes or updates.
2. Communicated changes to team, performed proper git merges and pull requests to get code to the codebase.
3. Pair programmed with the Front End Architect.
HTML/CSS:
1.Student did not match the layout design, there are visible user interface inconsistencies across the project.
2. Student layed out the design that matches the example well.  CSS fundamentals such as: box model, flexbox, and positioning were used appropriately. 
 3. Student's code is clean and organized, proper indentation is apparent, a library or framework was researched and used.  
 Responsiveness:
 1.Site is not very responsive, horizontal scroll bars are vizible throughout the app, desktop view does not respond to a mobile view of 500px or below
2. Phone views look professional at 500px and below and Desktop views look professional at 1000px and above. No horizontal scrollbars exist.
 3. Tablet views look professional at 800px and above. Responsive units are used for font-sizing.   
 JavaScript Fundamentals:
 1. There is JavaScript in the page but there are errors in the console when running the page.  Code is there but not readable.
 2. Objects were created, Array methods were used, code is readable. No errors in the console when opening the web page.
 3. Any of the following were used: .map(), .reduce(), .filter(), .sort(), constructors were used to build new objedects.
 Applied JavaScript:
 1. 1 or two event listeners were used and or little to no DOM manipulation occured.
 2. Event Listeners were used, DOM manipulation occured.
 3. A reusable component was built.  The component should be able to take any number of elements and continue to work well.  Example: Accordion with any amount of panels.
